                    <li>The game is organized around ten digits (0-9) and four mathematical operations: +, -, *, / (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). </li>
                    <br>    
                    <li>The first player (Player 1) will be even and the second player (Computer or Player 2) will be odd. Player 1 has to try and end up with an even number at the end of the game, and Player 2 should try and end up with an odd number. </li>
                    <br>    
                    <li>From the start, Player 1 plays a number, then Player 2 plays a number and a function. Neither player can multiply or divide by 0. </li>
                    <br>    
                    <li>You can only use a number once. Each player plays a number and an operation in turn. The game finishes when all the numbers are used. </li>
